dialogue \"<speaker>\" \"<text>\"

choice \"<text>\" <scene id>
The player sees <text>, and choosing it jumps to <scene id>."

dialogue "" "If a scene has no choices, it will continue to the next non-empty scene id"

dialogue "" "Flags are powerful tools for branching logic."
dialogue "" "Use:
set \"<flag name>\" - activates a flag when a choice is made
if \"<expression>\" - shows dialogue or choice only if expression is true
flag names should contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores, no spaces"

dialogue "" "Example:
choice \"A choice\" 2 set \"A\" - this will set flag A when chosen
dialogue \"\" \"A dialogue\" if \"A\" - this will only show up when flag A is active"

dialogue "" "You can use logical operators to make complex conditional expressions."
dialogue "" "They are:
not A - evaluates to True if A is not active
A and B - evaluates to True if A and B are both active
A or B - evaluates to True if either A or B or both is active
A and ( B or C ) - evaluates B or C first"

dialogue "" "Make sure the operators are separated with spaces, especially the parentheses"
dialogue "" "Don't do these for example:
AandBorC - this will assume AandBorC is one single flag
A and (B or C) - this will assume \"(B\" and \"C)\" are flags"

dialogue "" "Do these instead:
A and B or C
A and ( B or C )"

dialogue "" "You can also unset flags"
dialogue "" "Use:
unset \"<flag name>\" - removes a flag when a choice is made
unsetall - removes all flags when a choice is made (same as unset \"*\")"

dialogue "" "You can set multiple flags in a single choice"
dialogue "" "For example:
choice \"A and B\" 4 set \"A\" set \"B\"
will set the flag A and B when it's chosen"

dialogue "" "You can even make a choice to set and unset a flag at the same time"
dialogue "" "For example:
choice \"A and no B\" 4 set \"A\" unset \"B\"
will set the flag A and unset B when it's chosen"

dialogue "" "Lastly, you can preset flags to make flags active at the start of your visual novel:
preset \"<flag name>\""

dialogue "" "Use the command:

dialogue "" "When this dialogue is reached, the engine will look for
images/<image file name> and print its content first."

dialogue "" "You should only use this on dialogue lines, not choices!"

dialogue "" "Let's try it out with an image called 'test'."

dialogue "" "If you saw a smiley face above, it worked!" image "test"

dialogue "" "If you can't see it clearly, try resizing the terminal."

dialogue "" "You can create your own images as plain text files."

dialogue "" "Just make sure they're inside the images/ directory."

dialogue "" "To clear/hide an image, just use an image file name that doesn't exist, usually an empty string"

dialogue "" "So if you do this:
image \"\""
