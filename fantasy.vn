dialogue "-" "The clanking of gears, the rhythmic hiss of steam vents, and the low hum of turbines echoed through my underground factory — a steel womb I had crafted with my own hands."
dialogue "-" "Pipes crisscrossed above me like vines in a jungle, spewing wisps of vapor that danced in the amber glow of gaslight."
dialogue "-" "My boots clanked against the catwalk as I adjusted a brass dial on one of the pressure chambers."
dialogue "-" "I am Phoebe the Ferret."
dialogue "-" "Inventor."
dialogue "-" "Tinkerer."
dialogue "-" "Gunsmith."
dialogue "-" "Not the kind that hides in shadows or lurks in alleys — no, I build my world, bolt by bolt, in this cathedral of steam and fire."
dialogue "-" "My latest project, a new variant of my burst rifle, hummed quietly on the bench — almost ready."
dialogue "-" "That was when I heard it."
dialogue "-" "The familiar sound of steel toes on iron steps, heavier than mine."
dialogue "-" "Confident."
dialogue "-" "Purposeful."
dialogue "-" "Mercer."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Hope I’m not interrupting your court of cogs, sweetheart,”"
dialogue "-" "came his voice, a little raspy, a little smug."
dialogue "-" "I turned, wiping grease from my cheek with the back of my glove."
dialogue "-" "There he stood — Mercer the Hyena, hunter of the wastes, rifle slung across his shoulder, smirk as sharp as ever."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Well,”"
dialogue "-" "I said, raising an eyebrow,"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“either you missed me, or something broke and you're too proud to admit it.”"
dialogue "-" "He chuckled."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Can’t it be both?”"
dialogue "-" "I stepped down from the platform, approaching him with a wry grin."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“What is it this time? Scope jammed? Trigger snapped? Or did your pride finally overheat?”"
dialogue "-" "He reached into his coat and pulled out a brass cylinder, dented and cracked down the middle."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Your last tuning crystal cracked mid-shot. Lucky it didn’t blow my face off.”"
dialogue "-" "I took the part and inspected it, frowning."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“This wasn’t calibrated for that kind of charge... were you trying to snipe a dragon again?”"
dialogue "-" "He shrugged."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Only a siege cannon. Close enough.”"
dialogue "-" "I shook my head, muttering,"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“You’re going to get yourself killed one day.”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“I figured that’s why I keep coming back to you,”"
dialogue "-" "he said, softer now."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“You always keep me in one piece.”"
dialogue "-" "There was something in his eyes."
dialogue "-" "That glint."
dialogue "-" "Not just from the reflection of the boiler flames."
dialogue "-" "Something a little warmer."
dialogue "-" "I could answer with a tease, dig into the work, or maybe... just maybe, ask him why he really came."
dialogue "-" "What should I do?"
choice "“Let’s fix this first before it blows your head off next time.” (Focus on the work — professional and practical.)" 1
choice "“You didn’t really come all this way just to fix a cracked crystal, did you?” (Ask him directly — get personal.)" 2
choice "“Admit it, Mercer. You just missed me.” (Teasing — flirtatious tone.)" 3

scene 1
dialogue "-" "I took the cracked crystal in both hands, already scanning its fractures and burns."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Let’s fix this first before it blows your head off next time.”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“I knew you'd say that.”"
dialogue "-" "I walked over to my tuning bench and gently placed the cylinder into a brass clamp."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Sit tight. This one’s going to need a bit of finesse.”"
dialogue "-" "The whir of my lens goggles snapped down over my eyes as I ignited the flame torch."
dialogue "-" "Sparks danced like fireflies while Mercer leaned casually against the nearest support beam."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Y'know, you're the only person who talks to machines like they’re family.”"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“That’s because they don’t lie, don’t disappoint, and they do exactly what I design them to do.”"
dialogue "-" "He fell silent after that, watching me with that same unreadable glint in his eyes."
choice "“So... really, what happened out there?” (Ask for details about his mission)" 4
choice "“You keep staring. Something on your mind?” (Probe his mood)" 5
choice "Keep working in silence. Let him talk if he wants to. (Remain focused)" 6

scene 2
dialogue "-" "I narrowed my eyes, holding the cracked crystal up between us."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "You didn’t really come all this way just to fix a cracked crystal, did you?"
dialogue "-" "He didn’t answer right away — just shifted his weight and looked past me, toward the humming heart of my workshop."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Guess I needed to see something real for a change."
dialogue "-" "His voice dropped the playful edge. It wasn’t often he spoke like that."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Things getting rough out there?"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "They always are. Doesn’t bother me much. But lately... I dunno. Feels like the world’s creaking under its own weight."
dialogue "-" "I looked at him a moment longer, then gently placed the cracked part on the bench behind me."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "You’re not just here for repairs."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "...No. I’m not."
dialogue "-" "There was silence for a moment, thick with steam and meaning. The warmth in the factory wasn’t just from the boilers now."
choice "“You can stay for a while. I’ll make tea.” (Let him rest — show quiet support.)" 7
choice "“What is it you’re really looking for, Mercer?” (Dig deeper — serious and direct.)" 8
choice "“Getting sentimental on me, are you?” (Deflect with charm — keep it light.)" 9

scene 3
dialogue "-" "I tilted my head, a sly smirk tugging at my lips as I leaned in just slightly."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Admit it, Mercer. You just missed me."
dialogue "-" "He blinked, caught off guard for just a second before the corner of his mouth curled upward."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Tch. What gave me away — the three-day trek through the canyons or the part where I didn’t bother knocking?"
dialogue "-" "I chuckled, the sound mixing with the hiss of steam around us."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "I’d say both. But mostly the not-knocking part."
dialogue "-" "He took a slow step closer, eyes scanning my face, like he was searching for something underneath the soot and goggles."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "You know, I never really liked quiet places."
dialogue "-" "I raised a brow."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Because they make you think?"
dialogue "-" "He laughed, low and genuine."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Exactly. And somehow, yours is the only kind of noise that keeps me sane."
choice "“Keep talking like that and I might start thinking you actually care.”" 10
choice "“Careful, Mercer. You’re starting to sound romantic.”" 11
choice "“You want to tinker with weapons or feelings today?”" 12

scene 4
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“So... really, what happened out there?”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“A convoy ambush. We were escorting a supply train from the Eastern Ridge.”"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Bandits?”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“No. Something... else. They moved like shadows. Didn’t speak. Didn’t bleed.”"
dialogue "-" "His voice was lower now, like even saying it out loud made it real."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“You’re saying they weren’t human?”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Maybe Animorphs gone rogue. Maybe not Anima at all.”"
dialogue "-" "The torch in my hand sputtered as I turned the flame down, focusing on his words."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Sounds like something I should prepare for.”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“That’s why I came. You’re the only one who can build what I need.”"
choice "“Then tell me exactly what you’re facing. I’ll build for it.” (Get serious)" 13
choice "“You’re scared.” (Call him out gently)" 14
choice "“Heh. Sounds like you need me more than you admit.” (Playfully smug)" 15

scene 5
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“You keep staring. Something on your mind?”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Yeah... just thinking how this place feels like a different world.”"
dialogue "-" "He wasn’t smiling now. Just watching the glow of the forge reflect in the brass casings."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“It is. Down here, time slows. Nothing but gears and ideas.”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“You built it all yourself?”"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Every pipe, every switch. No one helped me. Didn’t need anyone.”"
dialogue "-" "A pause. He seemed to be measuring his next words carefully."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Ever wonder what it’d be like... if you let someone in?”"
dialogue "-" "That caught me off guard. My hands froze over the clamp."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“I don’t let people in, Mercer. They tend to break things I can’t fix.”"
choice "“You wouldn’t break anything... would you?” (Cautiously vulnerable)" 16
choice "“That sounded dangerously close to flirting.” (Deflect with humor)" 17
choice "“I think we should both stay focused.” (Back to business)" 18

scene 6
dialogue "-" "I focused on the repair, letting the silence settle."
dialogue "-" "The soft whirr of my tools and the occasional hiss of venting steam filled the space between us."
dialogue "-" "For a few minutes, he said nothing. Just watched me work."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“You ever get tired of being down here alone?”"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Alone isn’t the same as lonely.”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“Still. Feels like a fortress. Cold walls. Locked doors.”"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“I like my walls. They protect what matters.”"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "“What’s behind them?”"
dialogue "-" "I didn’t answer right away. The truth was... I wasn’t sure."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "“Maybe something worth protecting. Maybe nothing at all.”"
choice "“Why are you really here, Mercer?” (Challenge him)" 19
choice "“You want to stay a while?” (Invite him to linger)" 20
choice "“I’d rather talk about upgrades.” (Keep things strictly mechanical)" 21

scene 7
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "You can stay for a while. I’ll make tea."
dialogue "-" "He blinked, almost surprised, then gave a small nod."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "That... sounds good. Yeah."
dialogue "-" "I turned to the copper kettle nestled in the steam alcove, flipping the lever to heat it."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Still take yours with clove and rustleaf?"
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "You remember."
dialogue "-" "I handed him a warm mug, and he took it with both hands like it was something fragile."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Place hasn’t changed. Still smells like oil and cinnamon."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Some things are better left unchanged."
dialogue "-" "We stood there, quietly sipping — the weight of the world, if only for a moment, shut out by hissing pipes and clinking cups."
choice "“You could stay longer… if you wanted.” (Offer comfort — hint at something deeper.)" 22
choice "“Do you ever think about stopping?” (Question his wandering ways.)" 23
choice "“That crack in the tuning crystal… what really happened?” (Circle back to the job.)" 24

scene 8
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "What is it you’re really looking for, Mercer?"
dialogue "-" "He sighed, his smirk fading completely."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "I don’t know anymore."
dialogue "-" "He moved to the railing, staring down at the pulsing engine core below."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "At first it was just about surviving. Then hunting. Then... glory, maybe?"
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "But it’s not enough now."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Exactly."
dialogue "-" "He looked over his shoulder at me. His eyes weren’t sharp — they were tired."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Sometimes I think the only thing that makes sense anymore is you. This place. The work."
dialogue "-" "I wasn’t expecting that — but I didn’t look away."
choice "“Then stay. Help me finish what I’ve started.” (Invite him to stay — partnership.)" 25
choice "“You’re not broken, Mercer. Just... lost.” (Comfort him — reassure.)" 26
choice "“So what are you going to do about it?” (Challenge him — provoke action.)" 27

scene 9
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Getting sentimental on me, are you?"
dialogue "-" "He let out a breath that was half laugh, half groan."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Stars, don’t make me regret opening up."
dialogue "-" "I leaned back against the workbench, arms crossed, grinning."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Too late. It’s in the logbook now."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Fine, fine. I’ll pretend it was the boiler fumes messing with my head."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Or maybe you’re just warming up after all these years."
dialogue "-" "He gave me a look — half playful, half genuine."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Careful, Phoebe. You keep talking like that, I might never leave."
dialogue "-" "The words hung in the air, daring me to press further or let them drift away like steam in the vents."
choice "“Then don’t.” (Flirt — invite him closer.)" 28
choice "“You always were bad at goodbyes.” (Nostalgic — friendly tease.)" 29
choice "“Right. Let’s see if your aim’s still any good.” (Change subject — go to the workshop.)" 30

scene 10
dialogue "-" "I gave him a mock glare, crossing my arms but unable to hide my grin."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Keep talking like that and I might start thinking you actually care."
dialogue "-" "Mercer scratched the back of his head, suddenly more sheepish than smug."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Would it be so bad if I did?"
dialogue "-" "My heart skipped, but I masked it with a shrug."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Depends. Do you care about me, or just the one who fixes your toys?"
dialogue "-" "He looked away briefly, jaw tightening."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "You know I don’t let anyone else touch my rifle, right?"
dialogue "-" "There was something vulnerable under that tough veneer — something raw."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "...I know. I just like making you say it."
choice "“Okay, now hand over the rest of the busted parts.” (Shift back to work.)" 31
choice "“Is this the part where you kiss me or chicken out?”" 32
choice "“Let’s go somewhere less... clangy.”" 33

scene 11
dialogue "-" "I narrowed my eyes playfully, stepping around him to grab a wrench from the table."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Careful, Mercer. You’re starting to sound romantic."
dialogue "-" "He leaned back against a support beam, arms folded, smirking."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Maybe I am. Doesn’t mean I’ll start writing poetry."
dialogue "-" "I smirked, pretending to examine the broken crystal."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Pity. I’d pay to hear a haiku about me and a grenade launcher."
dialogue "-" "He laughed again, eyes bright. There was something electric in the air."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "I’m not a poet, but I know what I like."
dialogue "-" "I glanced up, meeting his gaze. It lingered."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "...And what do you like, exactly?"
choice "“Don’t answer that. I need to focus.” (Deflect with humor.)" 34
choice "“If you’re serious, prove it.”" 35
choice "“You’re not smooth, Mercer. But you’re trying.”" 36

scene 12
dialogue "-" "I placed the cracked part back on the table, dusting my gloves off."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "So, you want to tinker with weapons or feelings today?"
dialogue "-" "He raised a brow, caught between a laugh and a groan."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "Are those not the same thing with you?"
dialogue "-" "I laughed, walking over to my forge and igniting the pilot flame."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "Depends on the calibration. Feelings have worse recoil."
dialogue "-" "Mercer followed, standing beside me at the anvil."
dialogue "Mercer the Hyena" "I came here for repairs... and maybe a little more."
dialogue "-" "I glanced sideways at him, hammer in hand."
dialogue "Phoebe the Ferret" "You better be more specific before I start forging conclusions."
choice "“Let’s talk seriously — are we something?”" 37
choice "“More what? Tea? Trouble?”" 38
choice "“Hand me that spanner. Let’s pretend this is normal.”" 39
